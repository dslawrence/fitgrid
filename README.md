fitgrid
=========

Framework for responsive pages or page elememts that zoom in or out with the space available to them. Like CSS column frameworks this means that columns shrink and grow. Additionally, items grow taller and shorter and fonts increase and decrease in size. The end result is a completely "zoom-able" element capable of resizing to fit exactly to any space you give it.

jQuery is required. The library is ideal for a tablet, phone or desktop applications. The large load required for the initial render makes fitgrid.js more suitable for apps than for websites.
